Project Summary: Outlier Detection in Consignments
Objectives
1.	Identify Measurement Inaccuracies: Detect consignments with potential measurement inaccuracies in CFT (Cubic Feet) and weight.
2.	Enhance Quality Control: Improve quality control measures in logistics by identifying outliers that may indicate errors in packaging or measurements.
3.	Inform Operational Decisions: Provide actionable insights to optimize consignment handling and shipping processes.
Methodologies
1.	Data Aggregation:
o	Calculate total CFT for each consignment by multiplying length, breadth, and height, then converting to cubic feet.
o	Aggregate weight data for analysis.
2.	Statistical Techniques:
o	Interquartile Range (IQR): Utilized to detect outliers based on the 5th and 95th percentiles and interquartile range for CFT.
o	Standard Deviation Method: Applied to weight data to identify outliers by assessing values beyond Â±2 standard deviations from the mean.
o	Expected Weight Analysis: Estimated expected weight based on CFT and flagged inconsistencies beyond 20% deviation from the expected weight.
3.	SQL Queries: Developed structured queries to implement the above methodologies using common table expressions (CTEs) for efficient data processing.
Data Analysis Findings
1.	Outlier Identification:
o	Successfully flagged consignments as outliers based on the established statistical thresholds for both CFT and weight.
o	Identified significant discrepancies in weight and CFT, indicating potential mismeasurement.
2.	Operational Insights:
o	Outliers provided insights into potential inefficiencies in the packaging process or miscommunication of dimensions.
o	Highlighted the need for improved training and equipment for accurate measurement.
Proposed Solutions
1.	Enhanced Training: Implement training programs for staff on accurate measurement techniques and tools to reduce measurement errors.
2.	Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Establish standardized protocols for measuring dimensions and weights to ensure consistency.
3.	Automated Measurement Systems: Consider investing in automated systems for measuring and weighing consignments to minimize human error.
Model Efficiencies
1.	Scalability: The SQL-based model can handle large datasets efficiently, allowing for quick analysis as data grows.
2.	Accuracy: Statistical methods employed enhance the accuracy of outlier detection, reducing false positives.
3.	Real-time Analysis: The structure allows for near real-time data processing, providing timely insights for operational adjustments.
Conclusion
This project effectively utilizes statistical methodologies and SQL queries to enhance quality control in consignment management. By identifying outliers, the organization can implement strategic improvements to reduce errors and improve operational efficiency.
